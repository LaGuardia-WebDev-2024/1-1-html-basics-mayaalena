  <h1> She Walks In Beauty</h1>
  
  <p>
    
  </p>She walks in beauty, like the night <br>

Of cloudless climes and starry skies; <br>

And all thatâ€™s best of dark and bright <br>

Meet in her aspect and her eyes;<br>

Thus mellowed to that tender light<br>

  Which heaven to gaudy day denies.</p>

  <p>
